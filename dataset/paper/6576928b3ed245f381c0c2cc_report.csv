achieving these goals, like providing users with means for customizing the user
interface to their personal needs i.e. individualization designing content and
navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e. such as employees of
different levels, citizens etc, monitoring the user’s behaviour and adapting to the

ISO 9241-15 about command dialogues, ISO 9241-16 about direct manipulation
and ISO 9241-17 about forms. In addition, when designing multimedia
information presentations, the design principles and recommendations described
in ISO 14915-1 to ISO 14915-3 should be taken into account. Appropriate content
presentation also plays a key role in accessibility.","The System must provide End User and Administrator functions which are easy to

achieving these goals, like providing users with means for customizing the user
interface to their personal needs i.e. individualization designing content and
navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e. such as employees of
different levels, citizens etc, monitoring the user’s behaviour and adapting to the

achieving these goals, like providing users with means for customizing the user
interface to their personal needs i.e. individualization designing content and
navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e. such as employees of
different levels, citizens etc, monitoring the user’s behaviour and adapting to the
