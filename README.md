The tool Harmony will be a requirement processing tool in which requirements can be added. The added requirement documents will be analyzed for possible conflicting requirements. In this project, conflict will refer to the requirements which can confuse the developer on what to do. Duplicate requirements will be also considered as conflicting.

To provide an automated approach for generalized conflict identification, this project presents a two-stage framework that extracts the possible conflicts from the provided software requirements and outputs the conflicting requirements.
