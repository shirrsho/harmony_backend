User adaptation can also be important for\\r\\nmaking the user interface more accessible. Different approaches can be used for\\r\\nachieving these goals, like providing users with means for customizing the user\\r\\ninterface to their personal needs i.e. individualization designing content and\\r\\nnavigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e. such as employees of\\r\\ndifferent levels, citizens etc, monitoring the user’s behaviour and adapting to the\\r\\nuser’s goals that are inferred from the behaviour observed, recommending\\r\\ninformation that is potentially more relevant or interesting to the specific user,\\r\\nbased on the behaviour of all users or a user group.',\n",
